# Tailwind

Uses Tailwind utility / helper classes, with a mixture of BEM

Blocks = Modules of code that are elements e.g. using BEM
Components = small little elements that can be combined in to blocks (buttons, forms etc)
Utilities = Extra classes that can be used as classes on the front end

## Roadmap

Load CSS
Modernizer
jQuery (Optional)
descriptions in docs / files
JS as blocks / modules
Lint files
